1. Wikipedia is not your friend and is not the truth. It use your content and doesn't endorse you putting a political nofollow to everything. If Wikipedia steals contents without endorsing the source and then Google automatically give credit in a stupid way to Wikipedia then the only thing we can do is to Nofollow Wikipedia.
